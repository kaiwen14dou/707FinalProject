Aim 1: Benchmark subgroup performance of state-of-the-art ECG models on arrhythmia.
We will evaluate how current deep learning models trained on large ECG datasets perform across demographic subgroups (e.g., sex, age, race/ethnicity) and institutional cohorts. Performance will be assessed using established measures of discrimination (AUROC, AUPRC, sensitivity, specificity) and calibration (Brier score, subgroup calibration error, calibration curves). This aim will establish a systematic baseline of subgroup disparities in ECG modeling.

Aim 2: We will introduce new quantitative measures that have not yet been applied in the medical ECG domain. These metrics will provide a more nuanced understanding of discrimination and calibration disparities, particularly under subgroup imbalance and distribution shift. Comparisons with established metrics will highlight advantages and limitations of each approach.

Aim 3: We will evaluate whether advanced representation learning methods (e.g., self-supervised contrastive pretraining, multi-task learning, domain adversarial training) can improve downstream ECG classification performance while reducing subgroup disparities. Models will be trained with fairness-constrained objectives and tested under institutional distribution shift. This aim will generate actionable insights into how representational strategies contribute to equitable and reliable ECG modeling.
